# SpookiUI

**🌐 Website: [spookiui.rooksnet.uk](https://spookiui.rooksnet.uk/)**

A **live configurator for the [Ghostty](https://ghostty.org) terminal**. Browse
and edit *every* option Ghostty supports from an interactive terminal UI, and
watch your changes apply **live** — when you run it inside a Ghostty window, the
very terminal you're in repaints as you edit.

<sub>Requires Python 3.8+ (standard library only — no pip installs) and the
`ghostty` binary on your `PATH` (or in `/Applications/Ghostty.app`).</sub>

---

## A note on how this is built

This started as a Claude project — a quick way to see the idea working. It
didn't stay one. After 20-odd years writing software, I pulled it back to the
keyboard and now maintain it by hand, the old-school way: I read every line,
I own every line. Claude helped it exist; the craft since then is mine.

## Installation

SpookiUI has **no third-party Python dependencies** — it's a single script that
runs on the Python 3.8+ standard library. You can run it straight from the repo:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mattj85/SpookiUI.git
cd SpookiUI
./spookiui.py
```

Or run the installer (macOS & Linux) to check prerequisites and put a `spookiui`
command on your `PATH`:

```bash
./install.sh                     # installs to ~/.local/bin
PREFIX=/usr/local ./install.sh   # system-wide (may need sudo)
```

The installer verifies Python 3.8+, checks for the `ghostty` binary (warning
with install hints if it's missing), and symlinks `spookiui.py` into your bin
directory. After it runs, `spookiui` and `spookiui --help` work from anywhere.

To reverse it, run the uninstaller (pass the same `PREFIX` you installed with):

```bash
./uninstall.sh                   # remove the `spookiui` command
PREFIX=/usr/local ./uninstall.sh # if you installed there
./uninstall.sh --purge           # also delete SpookiUI's cache + saved profiles
```

It only removes the symlink it recognises as its own (never a file it didn't
create, and never a Homebrew install — use `brew uninstall` for that), and
leaves your Ghostty config and the repo untouched.

### Homebrew (macOS & Linux)

A Homebrew formula lives in [`homebrew/spookiui.rb`](homebrew/spookiui.rb). Once
it's published to a tap repo named `homebrew-spookiui`, install with:

```bash
brew install mattj85/spookiui/spookiui
```

Homebrew installs are updated with `brew upgrade spookiui`; the in-app updater
detects a Homebrew install and defers to it.

## Why it exists

Ghostty is configured through a plain-text file (`~/.config/ghostty/config`) and
**cannot auto-reload on file change** — you have to trigger a reload yourself.
SpookiUI closes that loop: it writes the config file *and* triggers a Ghostty
reload for you — clicking the **Reload Configuration** menu item on macOS, or
sending the running process the **SIGUSR2** signal it reloads on under Linux —
so editing feels live. It runs on both macOS and Linux.

Every option is discovered **dynamically** from your installed Ghostty
(`ghostty +show-config --default --docs`), so the tool always matches your
version — nothing is hard-coded. On this machine that's ~200 options across 13
categories. Options that only apply to the *other* operating system (macOS-only
settings on Linux, GTK/X11 settings on macOS) are **hidden automatically** so you
only ever see what's relevant to the machine you're on.

## The live loop

```
 you edit a value ─▶ SpookiUI writes the config file
                          │
                          ├─▶ validates it with `ghostty +validate-config`
                          │       (an invalid value is rejected & rolled back)
                          │
                          └─▶ reloads Ghostty ─▶ your terminal repaints
                                  (macOS: "Reload Configuration" menu item via
                                   AppleScript · Linux: SIGUSR2 to the process)
```

- **Safe:** every change is validated by Ghostty itself before it's saved. Bad
  values never reach your config.
- **Reversible:** a dated backup (`config.spookiui.YYYYMMDD.bak`) is made on the
  first change of the day, the TUI can revert an entire session with `R`, and you
  can wipe the config back to Ghostty's built-in defaults with `X` (a backup is
  still kept).
- **Live preview:** while picking a theme, font, or enum value, each highlighted
  option is applied as you scroll — cancel and it snaps back to where you were.

## Live reload by platform

Ghostty can't watch its config file for changes, so SpookiUI triggers the reload
for you. How that happens — and what it needs — depends on your OS:

| Platform | How the reload fires | Requirements |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **macOS** | Clicks the **Reload Configuration** menu item via AppleScript (`osascript`) | Ghostty must be running; your terminal needs **Accessibility** permission (*System Settings → Privacy & Security → Accessibility*). Ghostty is located on `PATH` or at `/Applications/Ghostty.app`. |
| **Linux** | Sends **`SIGUSR2`** to the running Ghostty process(es), which Ghostty reloads on | Ghostty must be running; `pgrep` (from `procps`/`procps-ng`, present on essentially every distro) is used to find it. No extra permission needed. Works on any distribution — detection is generic (`sys.platform`), with no distro-specific code. |
| **Other** | *No auto-reload* — the file is still written and validated | Trigger your own `reload_config` keybind in Ghostty to apply. |

On **Linux**, Ghostty is found via `PATH` (`shutil.which`), falling back to
`/usr/bin/ghostty` and `/usr/local/bin/ghostty`. Only Python 3.8+ (standard
library) and the `ghostty` binary are required; live reload additionally needs
`pgrep` and a running Ghostty instance.

If a reload can't be triggered (Ghostty isn't running, missing permission, or an
unsupported platform), your change is **still written and validated safely** —
SpookiUI just tells you to reload manually. A few options (e.g. `language`) can't
be applied without a restart at all; the UI flags these as *needs restart* /
*new windows only* so there are no surprises.

When your terminal font is a **Nerd Font**, each category in the left column
gets an icon (palette, font, cursor, apple/linux, …). SpookiUI detects this from
Ghostty's `font-family`; if no Nerd Font is set it shows a one-time note on how
to install one for your platform and then runs without icons. Force it either
way with `SPOOKIUI_ICONS=1` / `SPOOKIUI_ICONS=0`.

Editors are typed to each option:

- **booleans** toggle instantly
- **enums / font** open a searchable picker with live preview, listing *every*
  valid choice Ghostty documents (e.g. all 11 `macos-icon` styles)
- **theme** opens the picker with a **live colour card** for the highlighted
  theme — its 16-colour palette and a foreground-on-background sample, rendered
  right beside the list so you see a theme before applying it
- **bounded numbers** (opacity, `minimum-contrast`, …) open a **visual slider** —
  `←`/`→` to adjust, `PgUp`/`PgDn` for larger jumps, `Home`/`End` for the ends,
  all previewed live
- **other numbers** step with `↑`/`↓` or `+`/`-`, or type a value
- **colors / text** take a typed value (`#rrggbb` or a named color); colours show
  a swatch, and colour options preview the active palette in the detail pane
- **keybindings** open a **guided builder** — toggle modifiers (`super`/`ctrl`/
  `alt`/`shift`, where `super` is ⌘ on macOS), press or pick the key, and choose
  the action from Ghostty's own action list; the result is validated before it's
  added
- **other lists** (`palette`, `env`, font fallbacks, …) get an add/edit/delete
  editor

**Auto-apply off** stages your edits in memory instead of touching disk; press
`s` to write + reload them all at once.

On macOS you can also restyle the **app icon** from here: pick a `macos-icon`
style (`official`, `blueprint`, `chalkboard`, `microchip`, `glass`,
`holographic`, `paper`, `retro`, `xray`, …) and, with `custom-style`, tweak
`macos-icon-frame` plus the `macos-icon-ghost-color` / `macos-icon-screen-color`
(which get live swatches). See the icon gallery at
<https://noahskelton.github.io/ghostty-icons/>.

## Profiles & the config doctor

**Profiles** are named snapshots of your whole config — press `p` in the TUI (or
use `spookiui profile …`) to save the current setup, then load it back later.
Save a `light` and a `dark` profile and the `t` key (or `spookiui profile
toggle`) flips between them instantly. Loading a profile is validated and backs
up your current config first, like every other change. Profiles live in
`$XDG_DATA_HOME/spookiui/profiles` (`~/.local/share/…` by default), outside
Ghostty's own config dir so it never reads them.

**`spookiui doctor`** (or `c` in the TUI) health-checks your config and reports:
invalid settings, unknown/typo'd options, options set more than once (dead
lines), settings that just repeat a default, and keybind triggers bound twice or
shadowing a Ghostty default. Findings are grouped by severity; it exits non-zero
when there are errors, so it drops cleanly into a pre-commit hook for dotfiles.

## Utils — one-shot fixes

The **Utils** category (last entry in the left pane, or press `v` anywhere)
collects small, one-shot maintenance actions that aren't Ghostty config options.
Highlight an action to read what it does; press `Enter`/`→` to run it.

### Fix SSH

Ghostty tells programs it is **`xterm-ghostty`** (via the `TERM` variable). When
you SSH into another machine, that host looks `xterm-ghostty` up in **its own**
terminfo database — and most remote boxes have never heard of it. The remote
shell then misbehaves: garbled or dead keys, missing colour, broken
`clear`/`tput`, or the classic `Error opening terminal: xterm-ghostty`.

**Fix SSH** adds one line to your shell rc (`~/.zshrc` or `~/.bashrc`, whichever
matches your login shell):

```sh
alias ssh="TERM=xterm-256color ssh"
```

so the `ssh` command runs with **`xterm-256color`** — a terminfo entry
essentially every host already ships. Your local Ghostty session keeps its full
`xterm-ghostty` features; only the outbound SSH connection is downgraded to the
universally-understood value. Nothing on the remote host is changed.

It's **safe and idempotent**: it first scans your shell rc files (`.zshrc`,
`.bashrc`, `.bash_profile`, …) and does nothing if the alias is already there;
otherwise it appends the line and syntax-checks the file. Because a running shell
can't be modified from outside, it then tells you to `source` the file or open a
new terminal for the alias to take effect. To undo, delete the alias line. (A
more thorough alternative is copying Ghostty's terminfo to each host, but this
alias is the quick fix that needs no remote access.)

Run it from the CLI too:

```bash
./spookiui.py fix-ssh            # add the alias if it's missing
./spookiui.py fix-ssh --check    # report whether it's present; change nothing
./spookiui.py fix-ssh --explain  # print the full what/why, then exit
```

## Treats — fun background shaders

The **Treats** category (press `t` anywhere, or find it in the left pane)
bundles a handful of nostalgic, animated background shaders. Ghostty can run a
ShaderToy-style GLSL shader behind the terminal grid; a treat is one SpookiUI
writes for you into `<ghostty-config-dir>/shaders/spookiui/` and toggles on via
`custom-shader`.

Current treats:

- **Matrix Rain** — falling green glyph columns, `cmatrix`-style
- **Pipes** — a neon homage to the Win95 3D Pipes screensaver
- **Mystify** — bouncing, colour-trailing polygons (the Windows Mystify saver)
- **Plasma** — a rolling demoscene / After Dark plasma field
- **Lava Lamp** — slow rising metaball blobs (a 70s lava lamp / Bubbles saver)
- **Fireworks** — rockets bursting into fading, gravity-pulled sparks
- **Chomper** — a chomping wedge eats a row of pellets, chased by a ghost (a nod
  to the 1980 maze arcade classic)
- **Barrels** — barrels tumble down slanted girders (a wink at the 1981 platform
  arcade classic)
- **Jumper** — a hero hops beneath scrolling question-blocks (a nostalgic nod to
  side-scrolling platformers)

Seasonal packs:

- **Ghosts** _(Halloween)_ — friendly cartoon ghosts drift by, bobbing and fading
- **Spooky Eyes** _(Halloween)_ — pairs of glowing eyes blink open in the dark
- **Cobwebs** _(Halloween)_ — faint spider webs shimmer across the corners
- **Snow** _(Winter)_ — soft snowflakes drift down across a few depth layers

The game-inspired treats (Chomper / Barrels / Jumper) are drawn from plain
shapes only — they evoke the vibe of those classics without using any game
artwork, in the same "homage" spirit as the Pipes and Mystify treats. SpookiUI
gently points out the pack that fits the season (e.g. the Halloween treats in
October) in the treats list and overlay — nothing is auto-enabled.

They're designed to stay out of your way:

- **All off by default** — nothing is enabled unless you ask.
- **One at a time** — only a single treat can be active; enabling one turns off
  whichever was on, so background effects never stack.
- **Text stays legible** — every treat composites through a mask that only tints
  pixels still showing your background colour; your text, cursor, and borders are
  left alone. The mask fades out across your theme's own text-to-background
  contrast rather than at a fixed cutoff, so it follows the same edges your font's
  antialiasing draws and a treat passes behind words instead of being stencilled
  around them. Brightness is kept deliberately low.
- **Works with your theme, whatever it is** — the mask measures how far a pixel is
  from your *actual* background colour, which SpookiUI reads out of your
  configured theme, rather than assuming background means near-black. That matters
  well beyond light themes: anything brighter than a very dark grey used to fall
  outside the old mask, which quietly hid treats altogether on Dracula, Nord, One
  Dark and Gruvbox. On a light theme a treat also switches from emitting light to
  laying down ink — the same colours, absorbed instead of glowing, since adding a
  glow to a white background would be invisible — tuned so a treat is no more or
  less prominent than it is on a dark one. With a `theme = light:…,dark:…` pair
  SpookiUI bakes in both and the shader follows whichever one is showing, so
  treats keep up when the system flips between light and dark.
- **Light on resources** — SpookiUI sets `custom-shader-animation = true`, which
  animates only the *focused* window. Open (and focus) another terminal and the
  treat pauses in the ones you're no longer looking at, so at most one window is
  ever animating. Each treat is also deliberately cheap — a small, fixed number of
  texture fetches (one for the pixel, plus a fixed set the texture cache serves to
  read back the background colour) and small, fixed per-frame work.
- **Non-destructive** — treats are namespaced under `shaders/spookiui/`, so any
  `custom-shader` you added yourself is preserved, and toggling follows the same
  validate → back up → write → reload → rollback discipline as every other edit.

- **Adjustable vibrancy** — a single 0–100% control fades the active treat's
  animation up or down (100% is the tuned default, 0% is invisible). Pick the
  **Vibrancy** row in the treats overlay to open the slider (or press `v`), or use
  `treats vibrancy <0-100>` from the CLI. It's a global preference, so it applies
  to whichever treat you turn on.
- **Dim unfocused windows** — the treat animation only ever plays in the
  *focused* window; this setting controls what the others show. **On**, unfocused
  windows dim + desaturate so the active one stands out (a tiny no-op shader
  handles it even with no treat running); **off**, they show the plain terminal.
  Toggle it from the **Dim unfocused** row in the overlay or `treats dim on|off`,
  and it persists across sessions. Requires a Ghostty build that exposes the focus
  shader uniform.

Toggle them in the TUI (`Space`/`Enter`, `v` for vibrancy), or from the CLI:

```bash
./spookiui.py treats list                 # show treats, vibrancy, dim, and which one is on
./spookiui.py treats enable matrix-rain    # make this the active treat (replaces any other)
./spookiui.py treats disable pipes         # turn the active treat off
./spookiui.py treats only plasma           # same as enable — one treat at a time
./spookiui.py treats clear                 # turn the treat off
./spookiui.py treats vibrancy 60           # fade the animation to 60% (blank prints current)
./spookiui.py treats dim off               # stop dimming unfocused windows (blank prints current)
```

## Scriptable CLI

Everything the TUI does is also available non-interactively:

```bash
./spookiui.py list [category]      # list options (＊ = changed from default)
./spookiui.py list [category] --all # include options for the other OS
./spookiui.py get   <key>          # print an option's current value
./spookiui.py doc   <key>          # show an option's documentation + choices
./spookiui.py set   <key> <value>… # set (writes + reloads live); repeat value for lists
./spookiui.py set   <key> <v> --no-reload   # write without reloading
./spookiui.py reset --yes          # clear config & restore all Ghostty defaults (backup kept)
./spookiui.py version              # print version & check GitHub for a newer release
./spookiui.py update               # update in place to the latest release (git pull or download)
./spookiui.py profile save <name>  # snapshot the current config as a named profile
./spookiui.py profile load <name>  # apply a saved profile (validated, backed up)
./spookiui.py profile list         # list saved profiles  (also: show / delete / toggle)
./spookiui.py profile toggle       # flip between the 'light' and 'dark' profiles
./spookiui.py doctor               # health-check the config (duplicates, unknown keys, keybind clashes…)
./spookiui.py fix-ssh              # fix garbled SSH sessions (adds a TERM=xterm-256color ssh alias)
./spookiui.py fix-ssh --check      # report whether the SSH alias is present; change nothing
./spookiui.py treats list          # fun background shaders (also: enable / disable / only / clear)
./spookiui.py reload               # trigger a live reload
./spookiui.py validate             # validate the current config
./spookiui.py themes               # list installed themes
./spookiui.py fonts                # list monospace font families
./spookiui.py path                 # print the config file in use
```

Examples:

```bash
./spookiui.py set theme "Catppuccin Latte"
./spookiui.py set font-size 15
./spookiui.py set font-family "JetBrains Mono" "Symbols Nerd Font"   # primary + fallback
./spookiui.py doc background-opacity
```

## Notes & limitations

- **Live reload works on macOS and Linux** (and degrades safely elsewhere) — see
  [Live reload by platform](#live-reload-by-platform) above for the per-OS
  mechanism and requirements.
- Edits to single-value options are made **in place**, preserving your file's
  comments and layout. New options and list options are written under a
  clearly-marked `# added by SpookiUI` section.
- The config path is auto-detected (`$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/ghostty/config`, then
  `~/.config/ghostty/config`, then the macOS app-support path).

## Updates

On startup SpookiUI quietly checks GitHub for a newer release. If one exists, the
TUI shows a `UPDATE vX.Y.Z` badge in the header (and *press `U` to update* on the
status line); the help screen (`?`) always shows your current version. Run
`spookiui version` any time to check on demand.

The check is **best-effort and non-blocking** — it runs on a background thread,
times out quickly, and stays silent if you're offline or GitHub is unreachable.
The result is cached for a day (under `$XDG_CACHE_HOME/spookiui/`) so it never
hammers the API. To turn it off entirely, set `SPOOKIUI_NO_UPDATE_CHECK=1`.

### Updating in place — no `git pull` needed

Press `U` in the TUI, or run `spookiui update`. No update server is involved —
GitHub is the source, and SpookiUI is a single file, so updating just swaps that
file:

- **Git checkout** (the default `install.sh` layout) → it runs `git pull` for you.
- **Standalone copy** → it downloads the latest release's `spookiui.py`, *verifies
  it compiles*, then atomically replaces the file (keeping a `.prev` backup). A
  truncated or bad download can never leave you with a broken tool.
- **No write permission** (e.g. installed system-wide as root) → it tells you the
  exact command to run instead of failing silently.

Restart SpookiUI afterwards to run the new version.

Maintainers: notifications and updates only pick up a version once a matching
**GitHub Release** is published — see [`RELEASING.md`](RELEASING.md) for the
bump-and-release flow.
